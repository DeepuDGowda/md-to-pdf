# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 18.0 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.

# openAPI vs RestAPI

**OpenAPI:** a document that describes your REST API â€” what endpoints exist, what they do, what inputs & outputs they expect â€” in a standard, machine-readable way.

 **REST API:** the actual service â€” a set of HTTP endpoints that follow REST principles (stateless, resource-oriented, uses verbs like GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).

## Difference Between OpenAPI and REST API

| Parameters                   | **OpenAPI**                                                      | **REST API**                                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸ”· **What is it?**   | A **specification/standard for documenting REST APIs.**          | A style/architecture for designing APIs.                  |
| ðŸ”· **Category**      | Documentation & contract standard.                               | API design style.                                         |
| ðŸ”· **Purpose**       | To describe a REST API in a machine-readable, standardized way.  | To implement a stateless, resource-based API.             |
| ðŸ”· **Format**        | YAML or JSON document (the OpenAPI document).                    | API implementation itself (usually HTTP endpoints).       |
| ðŸ”· **Example**       | `openapi.yaml` describing `/users`, `/orders`, etc.              | Server at `api.example.com` exposing `/users`, `/orders`. |
| ðŸ”· **Standard?**     | Yes â€” maintained by OpenAPI Initiative.                          | Not a standard, but an architectural principle.           |
| ðŸ”· **Interactive?**  | Enables tools like Swagger UI, Redoc to render interactive docs. | REST API itself is just HTTP responses.                   |
| ðŸ”· **Relationship?** | Documents and defines the contract of a REST API.                | The actual API you build and deploy.                      |

## Example

You build this REST API:

    GET /users
    POST /users
    GET /users/{id}

You can define it in OpenAPI like this:

    paths:
      /users:
        get:
          summary: Get users
        post:
          summary: Create user
      /users/{id}:
        get:
          summary: Get user by ID
