# openAPI Doc Structure Details

## What is OpenAPI?

 OpenAPI is a **standard specification** for defining RESTful APIs — how they work, what endpoints they have, what inputs/outputs they expect — all written in a **machine-readable format** (YAML or JSON).

### in other words

#### If you’re building or consuming an API, the OpenAPI document serves as

- It's **contract** between the API provider and the consumer.
- A **blueprint** of the API.
- A source of truth for **developers, testers, and clients**.
- A way to generate documentation, SDKs, mock servers, and more.

## Why openAPI?

- **Clear communication:** All teams (frontend, backend, QA, external clients) can understand the API without ambiguity.

- **Automation:** Tools like Swagger UI, Redoc, and Postman can read the file and give you documentation, code, tests.

- **Validation:** You can test if your API responses actually match the spec.

- **Mocking:** Generate fake APIs before backend is ready.

## What is an OpenAPI Document?

An OpenAPI document is the YAML (or JSON) file where you describe your API, such as:

- API version & metadata
- Server URLs
- Authentication methods
- Paths (endpoints), HTTP methods
- Request parameters, request bodies
- Response schemas, HTTP status codes
- Example requests & responses
- Tags & grouping

### API version & metadata

- Every API needs a **name, version number,** and **description** to identify it.
- Optional metadata like contact info, license, terms of service helps consumers.

Ymal format example:

    info:
      title: Sample API
      version: 1.0.0
      description: This is a sample API.

### Server URLs

- Defines the base URL of your API.
- Consumers need to know where to send requests (prod, dev, staging servers can all be listed).

ymal format example:

    servers:
      - url: https://api.example.com/v1
        description: Production Server

### Authentication methods

- Defines how clients authenticate.
- Could be:
  - API keys
  - OAuth 2.0
  - JWT tokens
  - HTTP Basic Auth
- Without this, clients wouldn’t know how to gain access.

yaml format basic security example:

    securitySchemes:
    BasicAuth:
      type: http
      scheme: basic

### Paths (endpoints) & HTTP methods

- The core of the API document — lists all available paths (like /users, /orders/{id}).
- Each path can have multiple HTTP methods:
  
        POST: Create data
        GET: Read data
        PUT: Replace data
        PATCH: Update part of data
        DELETE: Delete data

### Tags & grouping

- Useful when APIs are big.
- Helps organize endpoints into logical groups (like Users, Orders, Admin).
- Makes the generated docs more navigable.

## Summary

| Concept                     | What it means                         | Why it matters              |
| ----------------------------| --------------------------------------| ----------------------------|
| API version & metadata      | Name, version, description of the API | Identifies the API          |
| Server URLs                 | Base URLs (prod/dev)                  | Tells clients where to call |
| Authentication methods      | How to authenticate (API key, OAuth)  | Secures the API             |
| Paths & HTTP methods        | Endpoints and actions                 | The core of the API         |
| Request parameters & bodies | What data the client can send         | Defines inputs              |
| Response schemas & codes    | What the server returns               | Defines outputs             |
| Example requests/responses  | Example payloads                      | Improves clarity            |
| Tags & grouping             | Logical categorization                | Improves usability          |


# Workflow-different stages

## openAPI workflow stages

The below diagram help you to understand the different stages of work flow between starting to deployment of openAPI doc.

![openapi-different-stages](images/openApi-workflow.png)

## Plan API doc & Content

Define what the API is supposed to do, and agree on a contract between teams.

<!-- ### Key activities -->

- Gather business requirements: What functionality should this API expose? **Who will use it**?
- Identify resources & endpoints: e.g., **/users, /orders**.
- Define **HTTP methods** for each endpoint: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

- Determine **data models & schemas**: What does a **User look like**? What fields are required?

- Specify **authentication & authorization schemes**: API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT.

- Establish **error handling conventions**: e.g., HTTP 4xx/5xx codes and error body formats.

### Best Practices

    ✅ Involve stakeholders early: product owners, developers, QA, external consumers.

    ✅ Document decisions clearly in a design document before implementing the API.

    ✅ Use a whiteboard or Figma for initial designs.

## Write openApi Spec

Write the API contract in OpenAPI format (YAML or JSON).

<!-- ### Key Activities -->

- Add **metadata**: title, version, description, contact, license.

- Define **servers**: base URLs for production, staging, etc.

- Write **paths & operations**: with parameters, request bodies, responses, tags.

- Create reusable **components**: schemas, responses, parameters.

- Define **security schemes**: and apply them globally or per-operation.

- Add **examples**: for requests and responses to illustrate expected payloads.

### Best Practice

    ✅ Use tools like Swagger Editor, VS Code plugins for authoring.

    ✅ Keep the spec in source control alongside code.

    ✅ Use $ref for reuse and maintainability.

## Validate & Lint

Ensure your OpenAPI document is correct and follows best practices.

- Run **syntax validation**: check that YAML/JSON is valid and conforms to OpenAPI spec.

- Run a **linter**: check for style conventions, consistency, recommended practices.

      Example tools: Swagger CLI, Spectral, Redocly CLI.

### Best  Practices

    ✅ Integrate validation into CI/CD pipelines to catch errors early.

    ✅ Define and enforce lint rules to maintain quality and consistency.

## Preview Documentation

Render your OpenAPI spec into human-friendly documentation.

- Generate docs using:

    **Swagger UI**: interactive “Try It Out” experience.

    **Redoc**: clean, three-panel layout for polished documentation.

    **ReDocly**: This will allow the user to test but its subscription model.

- Share preview links with developers, QA, and stakeholders for feedback.

### Best   Practice

    ✅ Host your docs on an internal URL or cloud platform.

    ✅ Customize branding, colors, and layout for external-facing APIs.

    ✅ Include sample curl commands and SDK examples if possible.

## Test & Iterate

Use the spec as the source of truth and refine it as the implementation progresses.

- Use **mock servers**: simulate the API based on the spec before backend is implemented.

- Write automated **integration tests** to verify the API matches the spec.

- Run **contract tests** as part of CI.

- Update spec whenever backend implementation changes.

### Best   Practices

    ✅ Treat the spec as a living document — update it with every change.

    ✅ Encourage developers and QA to report mismatches between spec and implementation.

## Version & Deploy

Version your spec, host the docs, and automate deployment.

- Commit spec to Git with semantic versioning: e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0.

- Maintain separate folders/branches for each major version.

- Deploy rendered documentation to:

      GitHub / GitLab Pages or Redocly Portal or your own servers

- Tag releases in **GitHub/GitLab** to track changes over time.
