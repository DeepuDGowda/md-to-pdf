## openAPI workflow stages

The below diagram help you to understand the different stages of work flow between starting to deployment of openAPI doc.

## Plan API doc & Content

Define what the API is supposed to do, and agree on a contract between teams.

<!-- ### Key activities -->

- Gather business requirements: What functionality should this API expose? **Who will use it**?
- Identify resources & endpoints: e.g., **/users, /orders**.
- Define **HTTP methods** for each endpoint: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

- Determine **data models & schemas**: What does a **User look like**? What fields are required?

- Specify **authentication & authorization schemes**: API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT.

- Establish **error handling conventions**: e.g., HTTP 4xx/5xx codes and error body formats.

### Best Practices

```yaml
    ✅ Involve stakeholders early: product owners, developers, QA, external consumers.

    ✅ Document decisions clearly in a design document before implementing the API.

    ✅ Use a whiteboard or Figma for initial designs.
```

## Write openApi Spec

Write the API contract in OpenAPI format (YAML or JSON).

<!-- ### Key Activities -->

- Add **metadata**: title, version, description, contact, license.

- Define **servers**: base URLs for production, staging, etc.

- Write **paths & operations**: with parameters, request bodies, responses, tags.

- Create reusable **components**: schemas, responses, parameters.

- Define **security schemes**: and apply them globally or per-operation.

- Add **examples**: for requests and responses to illustrate expected payloads.

### Best Practice

```yaml
    ✅ Use tools like Swagger Editor, VS Code plugins for authoring.

    ✅ Keep the spec in source control alongside code.

    ✅ Use $ref for reuse and maintainability.
```

## Validate & Lint

Ensure your OpenAPI document is correct and follows best practices.

- Run **syntax validation**: check that YAML/JSON is valid and conforms to OpenAPI spec.

- Run a **linter**: check for style conventions, consistency, recommended practices.

Example

```yaml
      tools: Swagger CLI, Spectral, Redocly CLI.
```

### Best  Practices

```yaml
    ✅ Integrate validation into CI/CD pipelines to catch errors early.

    ✅ Define and enforce lint rules to maintain quality and consistency.
```

## Preview Documentation

Render your OpenAPI spec into human-friendly documentation.

- Generate docs using:

    **Swagger UI**: interactive “Try It Out” experience.

    **Redoc**: clean, three-panel layout for polished documentation.

    **ReDocly**: This will allow the user to test but its subscription model.

- Share preview links with developers, QA, and stakeholders for feedback.

### Best   Practice

```yaml
    ✅ Host your docs on an internal URL or cloud platform.

    ✅ Customize branding, colors, and layout for external-facing APIs.

    ✅ Include sample curl commands and SDK examples if possible.
```

## Test & Iterate

Use the spec as the source of truth and refine it as the implementation progresses.

- Use **mock servers**: simulate the API based on the spec before backend is implemented.

- Write automated **integration tests** to verify the API matches the spec.

- Run **contract tests** as part of CI.

- Update spec whenever backend implementation changes.

### Best   Practices

```yaml
    ✅ Treat the spec as a living document — update it with every change.

    ✅ Encourage developers and QA to report mismatches between spec and implementation.
```

## Version & Deploy

Version your spec, host the docs, and automate deployment.

- Commit spec to Git with semantic versioning: e.g., v1.0.0, v1.1.0.

- Maintain separate folders/branches for each major version.

- Deploy rendered documentation to:

  GitHub / GitLab Pages or Redocly Portal or your own servers

- Tag releases in **GitHub/GitLab** to track changes over time.
